Inline: quick to impliment however when you need to change something you have to go looking for that component to change the style in line. Only to be used if absolutly neccessary.

Component Styling: Downside to this method of styling is you will fill up your js file. This can be remidied by creating a styles.js and importing that. Benifits are many to this method, some of which include better organization of your code and not having to go back and forth between css and js. this makes it easy to see where your styles are applying to your components.

importing CSS: This was a very common practice. One can argue that this is the best way to be organized with your components. All your css in one place with a different CSS file for each component in there respective component folder.
